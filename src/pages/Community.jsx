                    My work includes organizing workshops and events focused on bringing 
                    people together, whether through advocacy work, events, or shared spaces.

                    and supporting environments where people can connect and take action 
                    together.

                      worker power, and community-building in the hospitality industry.

                      events, and helping create spaces where workers can build
                      relationships, share knowledge, and organize for better conditions.

            I also organize recurring community gaming events at various locations in Chicago, 
            including monthly Nintendo Switch socials. In this work, I manage logistics,
            coordinate technology needs, and help foster an environment that
            is welcoming, respectful, and community-centered.
